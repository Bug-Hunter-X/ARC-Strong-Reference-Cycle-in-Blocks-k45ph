In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, it involves strong reference cycles within blocks. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@property (strong, nonatomic) SomeClass *someObject;

- (void)someMethod {
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self; 
    [self.someObject doSomethingWithCompletion:^(SomeClass *object) {
        // Strong capture of self within the block
        [weakSelf.someObject doSomethingElse]; 
    }];
}
```

While seemingly correct with the use of `weakSelf`,  a strong reference cycle can still occur. If `object` (the parameter within the completion block) holds a strong reference back to `self` (directly or indirectly), even though `weakSelf` prevents a direct cycle between `self` and the block, `object` prevents `self` from being deallocated. This leads to memory leaks, especially within long-running operations or large data structures.
